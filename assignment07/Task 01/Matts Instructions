I would probably go with order_product, you want to specify that there are products that are on an order, so "order_product"
I dunno what they are teaching but we generally name Many2Many tables after the tables they are joining, makes it easier to understand the model
something like this ( not checked for syntax )
-- Order Table
create table order (
	order_id     primary key autoincrement,
);

-- Product
create table product (
	product_id   primary key autoincrement,
	name         text,
	description  text
);

-- Order_Product
create table order_product (
	order_product_id    primary key autoincrement,
	order_id            integer not null references order(order_id),
	product_id          integer not null references product(product_id),
	product_quantity    integer not null default value 1
);
when you name things like this, it becomes bleedingly obvious what table they are referencing, and why the table exists
