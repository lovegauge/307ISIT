Haller was expecting an uptick in business during the economic downturn, the reality is a 
different story. Even people needing legal representation to keep them out of jail are having 
to make cut-backs, it seems. In fact, the most significant part of Mickey's business right now 
is not about keeping clients out of jail but about keeping a roof over their heads, as the 
foreclosure boom hits thousands of people who were granted unrealistic mortgages in the 
good times and now face being kicked to the curb by ruthless corporations.", "fifth.jpg");

A Very Shorty History of the World is the story of the world's people during the last four million years. It begins before the human race moved out of Africa to explore and settle the other continents, several of which were later marooned by the great rising of the seas. 
It is a story of the inhabited and world being pulled apart, and of it coming together again in recent centuries. Australia's distinguished historian Professor Geoffrey Blainey makes the past come alive as he touches on the trivial and the grand: on changes in diet and daily work and sport, on changing attitudes to the night sky,
as well as on profound discoveries and mighty empires.","world.jpg");
